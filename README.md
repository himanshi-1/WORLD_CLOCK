# Globe_Time_App

# Description
    
    1)The main motive behind to make this App was to show the Time data of diffrent country of
      all over the Globe live. 
      so i have used WorldTime API to show the Time data in my App.
      
    2)WorldTimeAPI is a simple web service which returns the local time for a given timezone.
      (is Currently in Daylight Savings time, when DST start and ends the UTC offset etc.)
