    I have used WorldTime API to show the Time data in my App. WorldTimeAPI is a simple web service which
    returns the local time for a given timezone. (is Currently in Daylight Savings time, when DST start and
    ends the UTC offset etc.)The API returns JSON Adding a suffixof .txt to any API, url will return a
